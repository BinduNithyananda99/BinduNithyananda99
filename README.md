## 🚀 About Me 
I'm Bindu Nithyananda, a Business Analytics graduate student at Sacramento State who transforms complex data into actionable business strategies. I specialize in bridging the gap between technical data systems and strategic decision-making turning SQL queries into boardroom insights and raw numbers into clear operational direction.

My career pivot from Software Engineer at Accenture to Data Analytics professional reflects my passion for finding the human story within datasets. I don't just build dashboards; I design data solutions that people actually use, automate processes that save hundreds of work hours, and create analytical frameworks that answer the real "why" behind business challenges.
